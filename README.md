## üå≤ü§è BLOOM-LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation for InstructorDoctor-200Kd ataset.

**We try to reimplement BLOOM-LoRA (much less restricted BLOOM license here https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigscience/license) using Chatdoctor-LoRA with this [**InstructorDoctor-200k dataset**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lyfqIwlLSClhgrCutWuEe_IACNq6XNUt/view?usp=sharing) or this [**InstructorDoctor-5k dataset**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nDTKZ3wZbZWTkFMBkxlamrzbNz0frugg/view?usp=sharing) following a paper, namely [**ChatDoctor: A Medical Chat Model Fine-tuned on LLaMA Model using Medical Domain Knowledge**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14070.pdf)**

**Why do we try to finetune these BLOOM models? Because the BLOOM licence seems to be more relax with [The BigScience RAIL License](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/the-bigscience-rail-license)! Moreover, BLOOM models were trained on the dataset having [59 Languages (46 natural and 13 programing languages](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) including [2.7% Vietnamese (7^th in total 46 natural languages)](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom)**

We try to reimplemt BLOOM-LoRA using a variety of sources such as [the original LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), [Stanford-Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca), [Alpaca-LoRA](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora), [BLOOMZ](https://github.com/NouamaneTazi/bloomz.cpp), and a name to few. These datasets for finetuning tasks can be found at [the original source](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lyfqIwlLSClhgrCutWuEe_IACNq6XNUt/view?usp=sharing) or [my HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/LinhDuong).

In addition to the training code, which runs on a single RTX 4090 takes a week or runs on 8 GPUs A100 takes around 8 hours using the InstructorDoctor-200k dataset. On the other hand, you can use the InstructorDoctor-5k dataset and run on a single RTX 3090/4090, it takes overnight.
We now publish a script for downloading and inference on the foundation model and LoRA,
as well as the resulting [LoRA weights themselves](https://huggingface.co/LinhDuong/doctorwithbloom/tree/main).
To fine-tune cheaply and efficiently, we use Hugging Face's [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft)
as well as Tim Dettmers' [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes).

Without hyperparameter tuning, the LoRA model produces outputs comparable to the Stanford Alpaca model. (Please see the outputs included below.) Further tuning might be able to achieve better performance; I invite interested users to give it a try and report their results.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Set environment variables, or modify the files referencing `BASE_MODEL`:

    ```bash
    # Files referencing `BASE_MODEL`
    # export_hf_checkpoint.py
    # export_state_dict_checkpoint.py
    export BASE_MODEL=bigscience/7b1
    ```

    Both `finetune.py` and `generate.py` use `--base_model` flag as shown further below.

1. If bitsandbytes doesn't work, [install it from source.](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/compile_from_source.md) Windows users can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/17).

### Training (`finetune.py`)

This file contains a straightforward application of PEFT to the Bloomz-7b1 model,
as well as some code related to prompt construction and tokenization.
PRs adapting this code to support larger models are always welcome.

Example usage:

```bash
python finetune.py \
    --base_model 'bigscience/bloomz-7b1' \
    --data_path 'LinhDuong/chatdoctor-200k' \
    --output_dir './lora-chatdoctor-200k'
```

We can also tweak our hyperparameters:

```bash
python finetune.py \
    --base_model 'bigscience/bloomz-7b1' \
    --data_path 'LinhDuong/chatdoctor-200k' \
    --output_dir './lora-chatdoctor-200k' \
    --batch_size 128 \
    --micro_batch_size 4 \
    --num_epochs 3 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --cutoff_len 512 \
    --val_set_size 2000 \
    --lora_r 8 \
    --lora_alpha 16 \
    --lora_dropout 0.05 \
    --lora_target_modules '[q_proj,v_proj]' \
    --train_on_inputs \
    --group_by_length
```
If you want to finetune with multi-GPU, for example with 8 GPUs A100:

```bash
WORLD_SIZE=8 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port=1234 
    finetune.py \
    --base_model 'bigscience/bloomz-7b1' \
    --data_path 'LinhDuong/chatdoctor-200k' \
    --output_dir './lora-chatdoctor-200k' \
    --batch_size 128 \
    --micro_batch_size 4 \
    --num_epochs 3 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --cutoff_len 512 \
    --val_set_size 2000 \
    --lora_r 8 \
    --lora_alpha 16 \
    --lora_dropout 0.05 \
    --lora_target_modules '[q_proj,v_proj]' \
    --train_on_inputs \
    --group_by_length
```

### Inference (`generate.py`)

This file reads the foundation model from the Hugging Face model hub and the LoRA weights from `tloen/alpaca-lora-7b`, and runs a Gradio interface for inference on a specified input. Users should treat this as example code for the use of the model, and modify it as needed.

Example usage:

```bash
python generate.py \
    --load_8bit \
    --base_model 'bigscience/bloomz-7b1' \
    --lora_weights 'LinhDuong/doctorwithbloom'
```

### Checkpoint export (`export_*_checkpoint.py`)

These files contain scripts that merge the LoRA weights back into the base model
for export to Hugging Face format and to PyTorch `state_dicts`.
They should help users
who want to run inference in projects like [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
or [alpaca.cpp](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp).

### Notes

- We can likely improve our model performance significantly if we had a better dataset. Consider supporting the [LAION Open Assistant](https://open-assistant.io/) effort to produce a high-quality dataset for supervised fine-tuning (or bugging them to release their data).
- We're continually fixing bugs and conducting training runs, and the weights on the Hugging Face Hub are being updated accordingly. In particular, those facing issues with response lengths should make sure that they have the latest version of the weights and code.
- Users with multiple GPUs should take a look [here](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/8#issuecomment-1477490259).
